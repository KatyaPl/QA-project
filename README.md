Hello, this is Katya. In the "QA-project" repository you can find some of the work I did during my Software Testing training in Soft Academy.All of the tests are checking the functionality of the specially made for the course Polling Application. In the "Positive-test-cases-in-JIRA" and in "Negative-test-cases-in-JIRA" files you can see the manual tests I did in the Polling Application.In the "Polling-Application.side" file there are some of my automated front-end tests,checking the functionality of the Polling Application.You need to use Selenium IDE to open this project. In the SQL subfolder you can see some of the back-end check ups I did in the Polling Application Database. Thank you for your attention!
